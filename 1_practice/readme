scalaVersion := "2.11.12"
sparkVersion = "2.2.1"
java version "1.8.0_77"


***Before start running:
1. Copy Wanjin_Li_task1.jar
and  Wanjin_Li_task2.jar from Solution folder into the ‘spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7’ folder in Finder.
2. Download reviews_Toys_and_Games_5.json and metadata.json, save their positions as input path.
3. Save a output path (must be an existed path).


***Running in terminal:
1.First, entry the position of spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7 in terminal.

2.
For task 1,
bin/spark-submit --class task1 Wanjin_Li_task1.jar path_to_/input/reviews_Toys_and_Games_5.json  path_to_/output/Wanjin_Li_task1.csv 
For task 2,
bin/spark-submit --class task2 Wanjin_Li_task2.jar path_to_/input/reviews_Toys_and_Games_5.json  path_to_/input/metadata.json  path_to_/output/Wanjin_Li_task2.csv 

[For example]
 if the json files save in an ‘input’ folder below the ‘spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7’ folder, and ‘spark-2.2.1-bin-hadoop2.7’ folder has an folder named ‘output’, you run following codes:

bin/spark-submit --class task1 Wanjin_Li_task1.jar input/reviews_Toys_and_Games_5.json  output/Wanjin_Li_task1.csv 

bin/spark-submit --class task2 Wanjin_Li_task2.jar  input/reviews_Toys_and_Games_5.json  input/metadata.json  output/Wanjin_Li_task2.csv
